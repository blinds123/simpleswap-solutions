# Product Requirements Prompt (PRP) - SimpleSwap EUR→POL Checkout Solution

## Executive Summary

This PRP defines the requirements for a bulletproof checkout solution that ensures customers can reliably purchase €19.50 worth of POL (Polygon) tokens through SimpleSwap, bypassing the platform's mobile price discrimination that forces amounts to €21.42.

## Problem Statement

### Core Issue
SimpleSwap implements price discrimination on mobile devices, automatically increasing the minimum amount from €19.50 to €21.42 when accessed from mobile browsers. This occurs because:
- SimpleSwap preferentially routes mobile users to MoonPay (which has a €21.42 minimum)
- Desktop users get access to Mercuryo (which accepts €19.50)
- The platform detects mobile user agents and enforces this routing

### Business Impact
- Lost conversions from price-sensitive customers
- Poor user experience with forced price increases
- Inability to offer consistent €19.50 checkout from landing pages

## Solution Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### 1. Primary Goal
Create a checkout flow that:
- **ALWAYS** presents Mercuryo as the payment provider
- **ALWAYS** maintains the €19.50 price point
- Works on **ALL** devices (mobile and desktop)
- Provides **100% reliability** for EUR→POL exchanges

#### 2. Technical Constraints
- Must be front-end only (static Netlify deployment)
- No server-side components allowed
- Must work within browser security constraints
- Should be lightweight and fast-loading

#### 3. User Flow
1. User clicks checkout on landing page
2. Solution redirects to SimpleSwap with locked parameters
3. Mercuryo provider is presented (green-bordered card)
4. Wallet address field is visible
5. Amount remains locked at €19.50
6. User completes purchase

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### 1. Performance
- Page load time < 2 seconds
- Redirect time < 1 second
- No noticeable delay for users

#### 2. Compatibility
- iOS Safari (all versions)
- Android Chrome (all versions)
- Desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Tablet browsers

#### 3. Reliability
- 99.9% success rate for bypassing mobile detection
- Graceful fallback options if primary method fails
- No dependency on external services

## Technical Implementation

### Current Solutions Deployed

#### 1. Quantum Bypass V2 (20 Methods)
Twenty different technical approaches to bypass mobile detection:

1. **Provider Lock First** - Forces provider parameter
2. **Widget API Exploit** - Uses widget-specific endpoints
3. **Session Pre-Lock** - Manipulates session storage
4. **Affiliate Override** - Uses affiliate parameters
5. **Double Encoding** - URL encoding tricks
6. **Cache Exploit** - Leverages browser caching
7. **Regional Bypass** - Geographic parameter spoofing
8. **Timing Attack** - Race condition exploitation
9. **Direct Checkout** - Checkout endpoint access
10. **Fragment Hiding** - URL fragment manipulation
11. **Business Mode** - Business account parameters
12. **Legacy API** - Old API version access
13. **Mobile App Link** - App deep linking
14. **Amount Format Trick** - Number formatting exploits
15. **Test Mode** - Development mode access
16. **Reverse Order** - Parameter order manipulation
17. **Multi-Redirect** - Chain redirects
18. **Error Page Exploit** - Error handling bypass
19. **Admin Preview** - Admin mode parameters
20. **Quantum Combo** - Combined techniques

#### 2. Additional Solutions
- **Manual Entry Simulator** - Desktop spoofing with user agents
- **Quantum Redirect Solution** - PWA and bookmarklet options
- **Direct Checkout Frame** - Iframe-based solution

### Technical Approach Categories

#### 1. URL Parameter Manipulation
```
?provider=mercuryo&force_provider=1&skip_moonpay=1
```

#### 2. Platform Spoofing
```
?platform=desktop&mobile=0&device=desktop
```

#### 3. Session/Cache Exploitation
```
?session=[id]&cached=1&skip_validation=1
```

#### 4. API Version Targeting
```
?api_version=1.0&legacy=1
```

#### 5. Special Access Modes
```
?business=1&affiliate=VIP&test=1
```

## Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs
1. **Bypass Success Rate**: % of mobile users who see €19.50
2. **Mercuryo Selection Rate**: % of users routed to Mercuryo
3. **Conversion Rate**: % completing purchase at €19.50
4. **Load Time**: Average time to SimpleSwap redirect

### Secondary KPIs
1. **Browser Coverage**: % of mobile browsers supported
2. **Fallback Usage**: How often fallback methods are needed
3. **Error Rate**: Failed redirect attempts
4. **User Satisfaction**: Completion without price changes

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Deployment (Completed)
- ✅ Deploy 20 bypass solutions
- ✅ Create test harness
- ✅ Set up Netlify hosting
- ✅ Implement URL shortcuts

### Phase 2: Testing (Current)
- Test on real mobile devices
- Identify most effective methods
- Document success rates
- Optimize top performers

### Phase 3: Optimization
- Combine best techniques
- Create smart router
- Add analytics tracking
- Build monitoring dashboard

### Phase 4: Production
- Select top 3 methods
- Create failover logic
- Implement A/B testing
- Deploy to landing pages

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **SimpleSwap Updates**: Platform may patch bypasses
   - Mitigation: Multiple diverse methods
2. **Browser Security**: Some methods may be blocked
   - Mitigation: Fallback options available
3. **Rate Limiting**: Too many redirects blocked
   - Mitigation: Client-side rotation

### Business Risks
1. **Terms of Service**: May violate SimpleSwap ToS
   - Mitigation: Using public URLs only
2. **Provider Relationships**: Mercuryo availability
   - Mitigation: Monitor provider status

## Maintenance Plan

### Monitoring
- Daily automated tests of all 20 methods
- Success rate tracking dashboard
- Alert system for failures

### Updates
- Weekly review of effectiveness
- Monthly new method research
- Quarterly security review
