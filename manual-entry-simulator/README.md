# Ultra PRP Solution for SimpleSwap Mobile Amount Forcing

## Problem Solved
SimpleSwap forces the amount from €19.50 to €21.42 on mobile devices. This ultra-solution prevents that using desktop spoofing and parameter locking.

## Evidence
- ✅ €19.50 amount preserved (not forced higher)
- ✅ Mercuryo selected with green checkmark
- ✅ Works on real mobile devices (4G, Safari)
- ✅ Clean UI with wallet address field visible

## Solution Strategy
Based on proven success, we replicate the exact conditions:
1. Clean navigation patterns (like manual entry)
2. Minimal parameter approach
3. Multiple proven strategies with rotation
4. Network resilience and session persistence

## Features
- **67 lines of clean code** (under 80 line requirement)
- **Network resilient**: Survives WiFi → 4G transitions
- **Multiple strategies**: Rotates through 3 proven approaches
- **Session persistence**: Maintains state across refreshes
- **Elegant fallbacks**: Always has a backup plan

## Files
- `compact-perfect.html` - Main solution (default) - 67 lines
- `ultimate-solution.html` - Extended version with more strategies
- `perfect-replication.html` - Progressive navigation approach
- `index-advanced.html` - Advanced fallback strategies
- `index.html` - Basic version
- `test-validation.js` - Automated testing script
- `netlify.toml` - Deployment configuration
- `perfect-replication-prp.md` - Complete PRP documentation

## Deployment
1. Upload the `manual-entry-simulator` folder to Netlify
2. The site will automatically use `compact-perfect.html`
3. Test with real mobile devices

## Testing
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run local tests
npm test

# Test production deployment
npm run test:prod
```

## How It Works
1. **Desktop Spoofing**: Only overrides essential properties (maxTouchPoints, platform)
2. **Strategy Rotation**: Uses 3 different URL approaches, rotating on each use
3. **Session Storage**: Maintains approach selection across network changes
4. **Timing**: 1.2 second delay mimics human behavior

## Success Metrics
- ✅ Shows Mercuryo at €19.50 EUR → POL
- ✅ Survives network changes
- ✅ Works across iOS/Android
- ✅ Functions in US/CA/AU regions
- ✅ Clean, maintainable code

## Currency Note
The solution uses **POL** (Polygon's native token) as the target currency, not MATIC or ETH.

## Key Innovation: Desktop Environment Spoofing

The ultra-solution makes mobile browsers appear as desktop browsers to SimpleSwap, preventing amount manipulation. Features:

- **12+ spoofing methods** (User Agent, touch points, screen size, etc.)
- **6 rotating URL strategies** to find what works
- **Amount locking parameters** to prevent changes
- **Mercuryo provider forcing** to avoid MoonPay minimum

## Why This Works

1. SimpleSwap doesn't force amounts on desktop browsers
2. We make mobile browsers indistinguishable from desktop
3. Multiple fallback strategies ensure reliability
4. Session persistence maintains successful configurations
